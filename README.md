## roniweiss12's omics visualiztion apps
This repository contains code to my shiny/mercury visualization apps, made to visualize omics data.

# Current apps:
1. view_contacts (Hi-C): This app is made to show Hi-C contact map and profile of user input's genomic coordinates.
    Data is in generated from .mcool files.
   Notice this app is meant to compare two conditions / cell-types, so the map isn't symmetrical.
2. RNA-seq visualzation tool: This app visualizes expression data (TPM) of two conditions / cell-types in both scatter plot and box plot with statistical significance annotations. It allows you to choose multiple genes at once to compare between them.
