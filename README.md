## roniweiss12's mercury apps
This repository contains code to mymercury apps, made to visualize multiomics data.

# Current apps:
1. view_contacts: This app is made to show Hi-C contact map and profile of user input's genomic coordinates.
    Data is in generated from .mcool files.
   Notice this app is meant to compare two conditions / cell-types, so the map isn't symmetrical.
