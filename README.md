# roniweiss12's omics visualization apps
This repository contains code for my shiny/mercury visualization apps, made to visualize omics data.

## Current apps:
1. view_contacts (Hi-C): This app is made to show Hi-C contact map and profile of user input's genomic coordinates.
    Data is generated from .mcool files.
   Notice this app is meant to compare two conditions/cell types, so the map isn't symmetrical.
2. RNA-seq visualization tool: This app visualizes expression data (TPM) of two conditions/cell types in both scatter plot and box plots with statistical significance annotations. It allows you to choose multiple genes at once to compare between them.
